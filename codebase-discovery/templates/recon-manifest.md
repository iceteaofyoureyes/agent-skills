# Recon Manifest

> **Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
> **Purpose:** Records what fed the recon so later runs can detect staleness. NOT an
> onboarding doc, but local process state, so git-ignoring this file is recommended.

## Run info

- **Mode:** full | code-only
- **Recon commit:** <git rev-parse HEAD> · **working tree:** clean | dirty (uncommitted changes
  were read, so the commit alone doesn't describe what recon saw)
- **Available inputs:** git for freshness (yes/no) · sub-agents (yes/no) · stakeholder (yes/no)
- **Exclusions in force:** <gitignore-syntax patterns from --exclude, beyond .gitignore and the
  defaults. Applied on resume, and drift in these paths is ignored by the freshness check.>
- **Navigation tiers used:** <which of declared manifests / repo toolchain / text search / AST search
  / LSP were actually available and used, and which answered the structural map. A graph from a
  manifest is fact; one inferred from imports is not.>

## Existing docs read (Phase 0)

| Doc | Path | Last modified |
|---|---|---|
| README | ./README.md | <date> |

## Coverage ledger (Phase 1 onward)

<!-- Every area, including the ones not yet reached and the ones --exclude ruled out. An area missing
from this table is an invisible gap; one listed as pending or excluded is a known one. Also the unit
the freshness check works in: the next run diffs the recon commit against HEAD and re-recons the
areas whose paths changed. Areas, never one row per file.

Recon depth comes from the closed set in provenance-and-status, and the rows below show each value in
use. Every state but full is a gap the entry point has to declare. -->

| Area | Paths | Recon depth | Source tier | Interview | Docs written |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| billing | src/Billing/, src/Invoicing/ | full | declared + text search | done (A. Patel) | areas/billing/* |
| identity | src/Identity/ | full | text search (inferred) | queued | areas/identity/* |
| tooling | infra/ | map only — dives not warranted | declared | n/a | tech/current-architecture.md |
| vendor-portal | third-party/ | excluded — user's `--exclude` | declared | n/a | tech/current-architecture.md |
| reporting | src/Reporting/ | **pending** — not yet reached | — | — | — |

## Files actually read (Phase 1)

<!-- The high-signal subset recon opened: bounded by design, not a listing of the repo. Only
needed for the no-git fallback, where these are hashed instead of diffed. -->

| Path | Area | Hash (no-git fallback only) |
|---|---|---|
| src/... | data model | <omit when git is available> |

## Freshness check log

| Date checked | Compared against | Files changed | Docs affected | User's decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <date> | <recon commit sha> | <n> in <areas> | <docs> | re-recon'd <areas> / full re-run / proceeded as-is (claims reverted to [unchecked]) / report only |
