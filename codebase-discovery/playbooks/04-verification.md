# Phase 4: Verification

**Role:** Code Reviewer (adversarial).
**Goal:** Hold the **generated** onboarding docs to a high bar. Treat each claim as unproven
until it traces to code evidence or a named stakeholder; anything unsupported gets flagged,
not published as fact.

Run this as an **isolated pass**, in a sub-agent where available, so the check is independent
of the work that produced the docs. On Claude Code, dispatch the **`codebase-doc-verifier`**
subagent; on other hosts use any generic sub-agent, or run the checks directly.

**Running them directly costs the independence, so say in the report which way it ran.** The agent
that wrote the docs is then marking its own work, and check 2 is where that hurts: invention is
hardest to spot in your own prose. Still worth running, and worth the reader knowing how much the
pass is worth.

A sub-agent doesn't know where this skill is installed, so skill-relative paths mean nothing to it.
State the checks in the dispatch prompt, and for each one that leans on a file in this skill, either
pass an **absolute** path or put the substance in the prompt. The checks below reach for
`references/output-conventions.md` (layout, naming, ceilings), `references/provenance-and-status.md`
(the flags) and `references/write-contract.md`. The secrets rule is the exception: the bundled
`codebase-doc-verifier` carries a synced copy, so only a generic sub-agent needs it pasted from
`SKILL.md` verbatim.

> **Prediction rule** (`SKILL.md`): verify what the docs **claim**, not what you suspect is wrong.
> Scoping the check to your own hypotheses is how a defect survives a passing verification.

## Checks

1. **Traceability.** For each substantive claim in the `docs/` set, confirm there is an entry
   in `docs/_discovery/traceability-index.md` pointing to real code (`path:line` / symbol) or
   a named stakeholder. Spot-check the citations actually say what the doc claims.

2. **No unsupported facts.** Any statement with neither code evidence nor stakeholder
   confirmation must be demoted to `[assumption]` / `[unverified]` or removed. In particular,
   check that no business rule was invented.

3. **No leaked secrets.** Check the `docs/` set against the secrets rule in
   [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md). Any breach is **blocking**: strip it from the docs and raise it
   with the user for rotation.

4. **Exception flags are honest.** Ensure accepted (unmarked) statements really are settled, and
   that every known `[outdated]` / `[contradicted]` item is either resolved or clearly flagged in
   both the doc and the assumptions register. Check each flag against what it means in
   [`../references/provenance-and-status.md`](../references/provenance-and-status.md); that file
   lists the causes, so don't judge them from a shorter list. No flag outside the five it defines.
   In `code-only` mode, confirm the caveat is in each `Status` header line rather than stamped
   over every sentence.

5. **Onboarding-lean, and scaffolding stripped.** Flag bloat: content that fails the "does this
   make a new joiner productive?" test, duplicated content across files, or docs exceeding the
   length ceilings in output-conventions. Also flag any leftover template scaffolding, meaning
   `<!-- -->` guidance comments or unfilled `<placeholder>` markers.

6. **Freshness & consistency.** Every doc **in the `docs/` set** has a `Last updated` date; the
   recon manifest reflects the files actually read; terminology matches the glossary across all
   docs. A sub-agent can only confirm the listed paths still exist, since it has no record of what
   recon opened; judging the list complete stays with you. The project-root `README.md` and the
   agent file are exempt by design (output-conventions says why), so don't add one to either.

   **Every link resolves.** Check each link in the `docs/` set, the project-root `README.md` and the
   agent file points at a file that exists. Skipped documents are the usual culprit, since the
   index templates list the full set.

   **Coverage is declared.** A coverage line is present in the entry point whatever the layout, and
   its absence is the finding. Where the system has areas, the area list matches the manifest's
   ledger too: every area present with its state, none reading as covered whose ledger state isn't
   `full`. A single-area system has no list, so the line carries it alone and skipping the check
   there is how a shallow run reads as a thorough one. This is the one coverage claim a checker can
   settle mechanically.

   **The glossary is one file.** Exactly one `domain-glossary.md`, at `domain/`, with no per-area
   variant beside it, and every term carrying an area or `cross-cutting`. A second glossary hides
   the cross-area clashes the single file exists to surface.

   **Names use the agreed language.** Area directories and concept filenames are glossary terms, not
   namespaces or codenames, with no catch-alls (`misc`, `other`, `general`). A file that couldn't be
   named specifically usually means the split was wrong. No output file is named `business-rules.md`
   or `workflows.md`; those are template names, and finding one means the split was skipped.

   **Groupings are evidenced, not invented.** A cluster named in business language must trace to a
   stakeholder who confirmed it; otherwise it should be named after the code unit and flagged
   `[unverified]`. An invented carve-up is worse than a technical one, because it becomes the
   structure everyone inherits.

7. **Markdown structure holds.** Check the source of every table: a header separator row directly
   below the header, and no blank line between rows. A blank line ends a Markdown table, so every
   row after it renders as literal pipe text. Confirm fences are balanced and any diagram block is
   well-formed. A register whose rows don't render is unusable however accurate it is, and no check
   that only reads content will catch it.

8. **Write contract honoured.** Check the output against
   [`../references/write-contract.md`](../references/write-contract.md), using the root, nav decision
   and pre-existing-file list Phase 0 recorded in `discovery-state.md`.

9. **Drift captured.** Every place existing docs (README/CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) contradicted the code
   is recorded in `docs/_discovery/assumptions-register.md` with a code-derived corrected statement.
   That register is what Phase 5 turns into the doc-drift summary, so it's the artefact to check
   here; the summary itself doesn't exist yet.

---

## Output

Produce a short verification report:

- Claims checked; count supported vs demoted/removed.
- Any invented or unsupported statements found and how they were handled.
- Open `[assumption]` / `[unverified]` / `[contradicted]` items and their impact, plus any
  `[unchecked]` claims and why each is still unchecked.
- Bloat or duplication trimmed.
- Go / no-go for harness engineering / Spec Kit, with any caveats.

**Record the verdict in `discovery-state.md` under Decisions**, with the unresolved items behind it.
Phase 5 reads it there and gates the agent file on it. A verdict that lives only in this conversation
is gone when the session ends, and the next run would offer an agent file over docs nobody
re-checked.

**On a no-go, record it in `assumptions-register.md` as well**, against the items behind it. The
state file is the one the disposition recommends git-ignoring, so a verdict kept only there is
invisible to everyone but the machine that ran the skill, while the docs it failed are committed.
The register is the committed audit trail and already holds those items.

## What counts as material, and what to do about it

"Send it back" needs a threshold, or verification either waves real problems through or loops.

**Material, so the docs must not ship as they are:**

- an invented claim, or an accepted (unmarked) statement with no evidence behind it
- a leaked credential value (check 3)
- a write-contract breach: written outside the agreed root, or a file overwritten without sign-off
- a claim carrying real weight (rule, threshold, permission, SLA) with no traceability entry
- a flag that misrepresents reality: a claim reading as accepted where the code has moved on, or a
  flag whose meaning doesn't match why it's there

**Not material, so fix in place and carry on.** Bloat, duplication, a missing `Last updated`,
terminology drifting from the glossary, leftover scaffolding, a dead link. Edits, not grounds for a
round trip.

**One rework cycle, then stop.** Route material problems to where they can be fixed: synthesis for
anything the code can settle, the interview only where it needs a person. In `code-only` mode there
is no interview, so those park in the register as *needs SME* instead of blocking the run. Re-verify
**only the affected documents**, not the whole set. If a second pass still finds material problems,
stop and report **no-go** with the specific unresolved items rather than starting a third lap.

---

## Exit criteria

- Every published claim is supported or explicitly flagged.
- No invented business rules remain.
- No credential values appear anywhere in the docs.
- Every drift item captured in the register with a corrected statement; register reconciled.
- Verification report written. Ready for the finish step (doc-drift + agent file).
