# Phase 3: Synthesis

**Role:** Technical Writer + Solution Architect.
**Goal:** Turn the validated understanding into a small set of **onboarding documents**: detail
docs under `docs/`, indexed by the **project-root `README.md`**, and enough to get a new
team member (human or AI) productive, and no more.

> **Prediction rule** (`SKILL.md`): never write an inferred rationale as though it were the design.
> That is the no-invention rule, and prediction is how you arrive at it.

## Read these first

This phase writes files, so three references govern it. Read them before starting; none is restated
here.

- [`../references/write-contract.md`](../references/write-contract.md) — where you may write, what
  may be overwritten, and the published-site decision.
- [`../references/output-conventions.md`](../references/output-conventions.md) — the folder layout,
  which docs exist and how they're named, the required header block and how to date it, length
  ceilings and formatting.
- [`../references/provenance-and-status.md`](../references/provenance-and-status.md) — the flag
  vocabulary and when to use it inline, how citations stay out of the prose, and **no invention**.

Phase 0 recorded the output root, the docs-site decision and the pre-existing files in
`discovery-state.md`; read them there. If the output root was never settled, stop and agree it
with the user rather than assuming `docs/`.

**Where the content comes from.** The references above govern *how* to write; the material is
already recorded in Phase 1's cited hypotheses, and in `discovery-state.md`'s **Facts**, **Glossary
in progress** and **Decisions**, which recon populated and the interview kept current. Open items
are in `assumptions-register.md`. Read those before writing, and don't re-derive from the code what an
earlier phase already established.

## What to write

The set of documents, where they go, and how they're named is defined in output-conventions. Three
judgements are this phase's own, plus two rules: one about coverage, one about evidence.

- **Create only what the system warrants.** Skip any document with nothing meaningful to say; an
  empty scaffold costs a reader's trust and gains nothing.
- **Apply the onboarding test to every document, section and paragraph:** *does this help a new
  joiner (or an AI harness) become productive?* If not, cut it. Favour the entities, rules and
  workflows a change would have to touch over exhaustive catalogues.
- **Place each fact by ownership.** Area-specific material goes in that area's directory under a
  logical name; anything no single area owns is cross-cutting and belongs at the top level. Getting
  this wrong is what turns one document into an unreadable pile, and the glossary in particular
  stays a single file whatever the system's size.
- **Partial recon still publishes, provided the gaps are declared.** Write what's covered rather than
  withholding everything. The entry point carries a coverage line whether or not the system has
  areas, and an area list as well where it does, per the coverage states in provenance-and-status.
  A claim about an area nobody read stays `[unchecked]` and unpublished. A partial doc set a reader
  can see the edges of is useful; one that reads as complete is the failure this guards against.
- **Record each claim's evidence as you write it.** A row in
  `docs/_discovery/traceability-index.md` per claim, added while the evidence is in front of you.
  See the traceability rule in provenance-and-status. Phase 4 checks these, and a claim carrying
  real weight without one is a blocking finding.

**Write the glossary first.** Area directories and concept filenames are glossary terms, so the
glossary has to exist before anything can be named from it. Naming a file for a concept that isn't
in it yet is what output-conventions' add-it-first rule is about.

Its terms come from a different place in each mode. In `full` mode, draft from what the interview
confirmed, in `discovery-state.md`'s **Glossary in progress**. In `code-only` mode nothing is
confirmed, so draft from the code language the glossary template points at, and take each meaning
from what that code does. Naming follows the same rule in both modes: the code unit's name until
someone agrees a business one, per output-conventions.

Use the matching file in `../templates/`; the area files use the same templates as their unsplit
equivalents, written per concept rather than per repo.

## Project-root README.md: the entry point

The onboarding set has **one entry point: the project-root `README.md`**, the front door for
humans and agents landing on the repo, and the one file the agent onboarding file links. In a page
or so it must:

- Say what the system is and who it's for (2–3 sentences).
- Link out to each `docs/` doc with a one-line description of what's inside (paths relative to
  the root, e.g. `docs/tech/current-architecture.md`).
- List the top open assumptions/risks, linking `docs/_discovery/assumptions-register.md` for
  the full list.
- State the run's coverage on its own line, always. Where the system has areas, name each one and its
  state as well. A reader, human or harness, must be able to see the edge of what's covered without
  reading the ledger, and on a single-area system that line is the only place it gets said.
- Where the code reveals it, a short "how to run / get started".

Produce it from the findings using
[`../templates/project-readme.md`](../templates/project-readme.md):

- **If no root `README.md` exists, create one** from that template: concise,
  onboarding-lean, with depth pushed into `docs/` rather than duplicated.
- **If a root `README.md` already exists, merge into it conservatively.** Treat it as a
  human-authored artifact, not a scratch file:
  - Preserve the maintainers' existing content, structure and voice. Add the onboarding index
    (system summary, the `docs/` map, top risks) and fill gaps the discovery genuinely
    improves, rather than rewriting what's already there.
  - Where the existing README **conflicts with the code**, don't silently rewrite the front
    door: record the discrepancy in `docs/_discovery/assumptions-register.md` and raise it,
    rather than overwriting it with an unverified correction.
  - **Confirm before writing.** Because it's an existing, outward-facing file the skill didn't
    author, summarise the proposed changes for the user and get sign-off before applying them.
  - No invention here either, and it bites harder on a front door than anywhere else.

- **Keep discovery metadata off the README.** Unlike the `docs/` set, it carries no header block
  and no inline flags: it's the project's own README, not a `docs/` file.

## Exit criteria

- Write contract honoured (root, overwrites, published-site decision).
- Only warranted docs written, each conforming to output-conventions; each passes the onboarding
  test.
- Project-root `README.md` is the entry point: created (if it was missing) or conservatively
  merged with sign-off, indexing the `docs/` set. Conflicts with existing README content are
  logged, not overwritten.
- Every published claim has a row in the traceability index; assumptions register is current.
- Ready for verification.
