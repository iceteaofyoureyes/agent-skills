# codebase-discovery

Extract **domain, architecture, business rules, workflows and a business glossary** out of
an existing, often poorly documented, codebase, and turn them into lean **onboarding
documents** a new team member (human or AI) can use to get productive. Designed to give an
AI harness (e.g. Spec Kit) enough grounded context before any specification or change work.

## Why this exists

Most real codebases are under-documented, and documentation tends to drift from the code over
time. Before you can apply harness engineering or spec-driven development, the agent needs real
context: what the system does, the domain and its language, the architecture, and the business
rules that live in the code. This skill reconstructs that context and writes it down.

## The core idea

> The code is ground truth for **what** the system does. Only people hold the **why**.

So it mines the code first to form evidence-backed hypotheses, then validates intent with a
senior BA / Product Owner **one question at a time**, spending their time on explanation and
judgement, not on re-deriving mechanics the code already states. Existing docs feed that, and
everything drawn from them is **verified against the code** (the source of truth) before it's
relied on.

## How it works: six phases

0. **Pre-check** — settle the output root with the user before anything is written, then read any
   existing `README` / `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `docs` and capture what they state, to verify
   against the code.
1. **Deep recon** — tiered, evidence-cited code analysis (structure → data model →
   contracts/edges → business-logic hotspots), token-efficient via sub-agents where
   available. Reads the structure the repo **declares** (build manifests, workspace files, runtime
   topology) before inferring anything from patterns. Validates the Phase 0 claims and records drift.
2. **Interview** — one-question-at-a-time conversation with the BA/PO, each question seeded
   by a recon hypothesis; contradictions raised with a code-based suggested fix. *(Skipped
   in code-only mode.)*
3. **Synthesis** — write the lean onboarding docs, each dated and provenance-flagged.
4. **Verify** — adversarial check that every claim traces to code evidence or a named
   stakeholder.
5. **Finish** — a **doc-drift summary**, contradictions reconciled with the user one at a time,
   and an optional **CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md** generated or added to (detect-and-match; offer both
   if neither exists).

## Modes

- **full** — with a stakeholder to validate findings.
- **code-only** — no interview. The provenance caveat is stated once per document rather than on
  every line, and everything still open is tracked in the assumptions register (see Status model
  below). For when no SME is available yet.

## Host-agnostic by design

No hooks, MCP servers or plugin format are required. Working memory and staleness detection
use plain files (`docs/_discovery/`), so the skill resumes across sessions and runs on any
capable agent. Optional inputs (the repo's own toolchain, AST/LSP tooling, sub-agents, a live SME)
are used when present and skipped cleanly when not. Text search is the floor that always works.

## Output

The project-root `README.md` is the onboarding entry point (created if missing, or merged into
conservatively); the detail docs are written under `docs/`, grouped and kept onboarding-lean.
There is no `docs/README.md`.

The destination is agreed rather than assumed. Because the output lands in a repo the skill
doesn't own, Phase 0 surveys the write target (is `docs/` a published site, is anything already
there?) and settles the **output root** with the user before a byte is written.

**Material is filed one concept per file, under names drawn from the domain language**, so an agent
working on billing loads `areas/billing/`, not every rule in the system. Area-specific material lives
in its area; what no single area owns stays at the top level; and the glossary is always one file,
with an `Area` column carrying ownership, because one place to look a word up is also the only place
a clash between two areas' meanings shows. A single-area system keeps the flat layout with no
`areas/` at all, because the trigger is whether the content has an area dimension, not how big the
repo is.

Coverage travels with the docs. Each area reaches the entry point carrying its state, so a reader can
see the edge of what was examined rather than assuming the set is complete.
[`references/provenance-and-status.md`](references/provenance-and-status.md) defines the states.

```
README.md                         # project-root: onboarding index / entry point — the file CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md links

├── business/                     # cross-cutting, or a single-area system's

    └── recon-manifest.md         #   local state — git-ignore recommended
```

`_discovery/` is deliberately kept out of the onboarding set and is never linked from
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`. Its two audit files are committed and its two state files are not.

The tree above is illustrative. [`references/output-conventions.md`](references/output-conventions.md)
defines the layout and is the file to trust if this README ever falls behind it;
[`references/discovery-disposition.md`](references/discovery-disposition.md) settles what happens to
`_discovery/`.

## Status model (exception-only)

Accepted knowledge is unmarked. Only exceptions are flagged (`[unchecked]`, `[unverified]`,
`[assumption]`, `[outdated]`, `[contradicted]`), so the reader's attention goes straight to what
still needs resolving, and in `code-only` mode the caveat is stated once per document rather than
stamped on every line.
[`references/provenance-and-status.md`](references/provenance-and-status.md) defines the model.

## Using it

Point your agent at this folder and follow `SKILL.md`. In Claude Code, drop the folder in
`.claude/skills/`. In any other tool, `SKILL.md` and the playbooks read as plain instructions.
